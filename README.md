# Jet Lag DC PWA

This project provides a Progressive Web App (PWA) that displays a Google Map of the Washington DC area with major metro stops labeled.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google Maps API key:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application is optimized for mobile devices and can be installed as a PWA when deployed.
